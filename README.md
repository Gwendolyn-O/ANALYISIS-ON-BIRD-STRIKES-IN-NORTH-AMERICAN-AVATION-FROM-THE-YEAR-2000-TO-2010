# ANALYISIS-ON-BIRD-STRIKES-IN-NORTH-AMERICAN-AVATION-FROM-THE-YEAR-2000-TO-2010
The analysis  shows the impact of bird strikes in North American aviation from 2000 to 2010. It highlights a time series of wildlife strikes, peaking at 7.2K in 2009. Large wildlife and fog were identified as major contributors, with Virginia and Washington reporting the highest strikes by state.
**OBSERVATIONS**
Unknown Small Birds Accounted For The Highest Number Of Strikes (52,005). This Indicates That Small Bird Species, Despite Being Hard To Identify During Incidents, Pose A Significant Risk Due To Their Frequency.
The Year 2010 Recorded The Highest Number Of Bird Strikes (7,657 Incidents), Potentially Attributable To Increased Air Traffic, Improved Reporting Practices, Or Rising Wildlife Populations Near Airports. In Contrast, 2004 Had The Lowest Number Of Bird Strikes, Suggesting Possible Factors Like Lower Air Traffic, Effective Wildlife Management, Or Less Reporting During That Period.
Virginia Recorded The Highest Number Of Bird Strikes Among The Top Five States (1,818 Incidents). This Is Likely Due To Its Proximity To Major Migratory Bird Routes And The Presence Of Natural Habitats Or Open Spaces That Attract Birds Near Airports.
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Accounted For 32.09% Of Bird Strikes Among The Top Five Airports, Making It The Most Affected. This May Be Attributed To Its High Air Traffic Volume As One Of The Busiest Airports In The U.S. And The Presence Of Large Open Areas Or Water Bodies Near The Airport That Attract Birds.
The Approach Phase Of Flight Recorded The Highest Number Of Bird Strikes (24,558 Incidents), Likely Due To Aircraft Operating At Lower Altitudes, Which Overlap With Bird Flight Zones. The Low Number Of Strikes During The Parked Phase Suggests Limited Interactions Between Aircraft And Wildlife In This Stage.
Most Bird Strikes (61,720 Incidents) Occurred Under "None" Weather Conditions (Clear Skies Or No Precipitation). This Is Expected, As Birds Are More Active In Clear Weather For Feeding And Migration.


**RECOMMENDATIONS**
IMPLEMENT ADVANCED RADAR AND TRACKING SYSTEMS To Better Identify And Monitor Small Birds Around Airports, Especially During Migratory Seasons.
ENHANCE WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT RESOURCES In Response To Increasing Air Traffic, Particularly In Areas Experiencing Rising Bird Strike Incidents.
MODIFY AIRPORT HABITATS To Make Them Less Attractive To Birds, Such As Reducing Open Water Areas And Tall Grass That Serve As Feeding Or Nesting Sites.
STUDY BEST PRACTICES Implemented At Safer Airports And Consider Applying Similar Measures At High-Strike Locations Like Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
UTILIZE AUDITORY AND VISUAL DETERRENTS To Keep Birds Away From Active Flight Paths, Particularly During Takeoff And Approach Phases.
INCREASE PILOT AWARENESS OF BIRD STRIKE RISKS During Clear Weather Conditions And Migratory Seasons To Encourage Additional Vigilance And Precautions.
